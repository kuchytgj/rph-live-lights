# Live Lights: In-game siren settings editor for GTA V
## Created by PNWParksFan

This is a RagePluginHook plugin for single-player GTA V. 
It enables users to view and modify all siren setting 
parameters live in game and import/export carcols.meta files.

You must have RagePluginHook version 78 or later.

This plugin is primarily intended as a tool for vehicle developers 
to create and modify siren settings. Users are welcome to use it to 
look around and try out making their own custom sequences, but it is 
not intended as a general-use siren controller.
